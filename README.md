60 day Women Who Code Python Challenge
To those that are using this repo to increase their skills and do the daily challenges, each challenge is posted as a comment (at least for the most part) in the first line of code.  Copy the challenge into your code editor and go to work solving it.  You can also come back and see how I solved the challenge.  Good Luck!
